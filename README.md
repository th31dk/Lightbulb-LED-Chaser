## Final Thoughts
I recently learned a bit of KiCad for my hackpad submission. After using both EasyEDA and KiCad, I can confidently say that I like KiCad better. Creating the schematic and PCB on KiCad seems more smooth to me. One thing I do like about EasyEDA, is that it has most of the footprints, symbols, and 3D models in the program already.
